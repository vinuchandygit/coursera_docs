I am trying very hard to install the R programming course on swirl . But now this error has occured

library(swirl)
uninstall_all_courses()
All courses uninstalled successfully!
install_from_swirl("R_Programming")
after this even after waiting for about 20 minutes I am still not getting any further. It is like Rstudio is stuck. My internet connection is quite good. 
AS I am connecte to a proxy server, I used this (found on another discussion thread ) 
library(RCurl)
library(httr)
set_config( config( ssl_verifypeer = 0L ) )
After this I proceeded to work normally but nothing productive was happening

library(swirl)

3: Don't install anything for me. I'll do it myself.
